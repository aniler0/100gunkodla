## Full Stack Todo App

This is my first Full-stack project. 

At backend side I used :

- TypeScript ( I wrote so many wrong and missing code because this is first time using Typescript)
- ExpressJS
- Mongodb

At frontend side I used:
- React 
- Axios to make CRUD operations and to get data from server.

**I've had so many problems when I was making this project.Some of my problems are frontend which are I didnt use Context API or Redux therefore there is so many props drilling. Also there is another problems in backend. I use TypeScript but cant write typesafe. If you want to help me of these problems you can make a pull request. I'll be so happy.**
