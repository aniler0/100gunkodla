## Full Stack Todo App

![todo](https://github.com/aniler0/aniler0.github.io/blob/master/public/projectimages/todoapp.png)

This is my first Full-stack project. 

At backend side I used :

- TypeScript (This is my first time using Typescript)
- ExpressJS
- Mongodb

At frontend side I used:
- React 
- Axios to make CRUD operations and to get data from server.

**If you want to contribute my project you can make a pull request.I'd be happy**
