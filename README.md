This is my first Full-stack project. At backend side I use TypeScript,ExpressJS,Mongodb. At frontend side I use React. 

I've had so many problems when I was making this project.Some of my problems are frontend which are I didnt use Context API or Redux therefore there is so many props drilling. Also there is another problems in backend. I use TypeScript but cant write typesafe. If you want to help me of these problems you can make a pull request. I'll be so happy.
