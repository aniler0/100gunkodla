## Full Stack Todo App

This is my first Full-stack project. 

At backend side I used :

- TypeScript ( I wrote so many wrong and missing code because this is first time using Typescript)
- ExpressJS
- Mongodb

At frontend side I used:
- React 
- Axios to make CRUD operations and to get data from server.

####I've had so many problems when I was making this project.Some of my problems are frontend which are I didnt use Context API or Redux therefore there is so many props drilling. Also there is another problems in backend. I use TypeScript but cant write typesafe. If you want to help me of these problems you can make a pull request. I'll be so happy.

## Personal Web Page

This is my first Next.js project. I learned lots of things from this project. 

I used:

- Context API
- Animation library which is 'Framer Motion'
- Next.js
- Styled Components
- Nodemailer which is used to send an e-mail to someone.
